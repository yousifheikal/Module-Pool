ðŸ’¼ SAP ABAP Module Pool Project â€“ CRUD Operations on Employee Table

As part of my SAP ABAP learning journey, I developed a custom Module Pool application that allows Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on an Employee Customize table using Object-Oriented ABAP (OOABAP). This project simulates a real-world SAP GUI transaction with full backend logic.
